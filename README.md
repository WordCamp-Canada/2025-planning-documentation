# Welcome to the WCEH 2025 Organizer Repository

## Overview
This repository serves as the central hub for organizing **WordCamp Canada 2025 (WCEH)**. It contains documentation, planning guides, and team-specific resources to help volunteers, organizers, and sponsors work together efficiently to create an incredible event. 

We've created some initial guidance for key aspects of running WordCamp Canada that we hope will be useful in kicking off your team discussions. These documents are **intentionally opinionated** to provide a strong starting point, but you have the freedom to challenge thinking, refine processes, and propose your own ideas. Our goal is to foster an inclusive and dynamic planning environment where collaboration leads to the best possible experience for attendees, speakers, sponsors, and volunteers.
