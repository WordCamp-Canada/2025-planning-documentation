# Speaker Liaison

Having dedicated speaker liaisons ensures that each speaker receives personalized support and guidance throughout the event.

## Key Responsibilities
- Assigning volunteers or staff to support speakers as needed.
- Managing speaker arrival, check-in, and navigation at the venue.
- Acting as a point of contact for last-minute speaker concerns.
- Ensuring speakers have what they need before, during, and after their sessions.

## Early Questions
- How many speaker liaisons do we need to cover all sessions effectively?
- What training or information should liaisons receive before the event?
- How do we ensure smooth coordination between liaisons and other teams?

## Opportunities for Excellence
- Develop a training program for speaker liaisons to provide top-tier support.
- Create a centralized communication system for real-time speaker needs.
- Implement a feedback system to continuously improve the speaker liaison role.
