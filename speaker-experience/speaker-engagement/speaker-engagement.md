# Speaker Engagement

Encouraging speakers to actively participate in the broader event experience enhances networking and knowledge-sharing.

## Key Responsibilities
- Facilitating networking opportunities for speakers beyond their sessions.
- Encouraging speakers to engage with attendees on social media.
- Coordinating speaker interviews or AMA (Ask Me Anything) sessions.
- Ensuring speakers have a platform to continue discussions post-event.

## Early Questions
- How can we encourage speakers to stay engaged beyond their sessions?
- What formats work best for informal speaker-attendee interactions?
- How do we create value for speakers beyond their presentation time?

## Opportunities for Excellence
- Host exclusive speaker-only networking events or VIP lounges.
- Provide opportunities for speakers to contribute to post-event content (blogs, recaps, etc.).
- Offer a dedicated Q&A session for attendees to follow up with speakers.
