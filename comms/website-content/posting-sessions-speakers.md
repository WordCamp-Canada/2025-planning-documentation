# Confirming Sessions and Speakers

The process to emailing a speaker and publishing their bio and session on the WCEH site is as follows. All email corespondence should be done via the canada@wordcamp.org email.

## Submission Acceptance Comms

### Step 1

- Once a session has been selected for WordCamp Canada [send this email](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vf-ZsqloqnucP4HOcTysFPY3GZMAbcien9R6bEsvLkI/edit?tab=t.0), updating their name and talk title.

### Step 2

- Once the speaker confirms they will speak at WCEH a [reply is sent](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wZcUnxwDhKmbU-UMamfVD5PG8wS_-0EIjehauYuWaTs/edit?tab=t.0) with the ticket coupon code
- In some cases a speaker may have additional questions, be sure to address those at this time

## Publishing to Website

The session and bio can be published by going to the [session posts](https://canada.wordcamp.org/2025/wp-admin/edit.php?post_type=wcb_session&orderby=title&order=asc)

**Note:** sessions and bios for the initial batch of 20 sessions that have already gone through the initial email process should be completed and ready to be published with a quick review.

If the organizing team have selected a new session to fill an open space in the schedule you will need to find the `(no title)` seesion based on the corresponding speaker name, and update the content. Each `(no title)` post has a link back to the spreadsheet to simplify this process.

The following items should be done / reviewed before publishing:

- Find the session name, open it as well as the speaker name (which should be in draft mode in the column to the right of the title)
- Review session posts: excerpts and categories should be in place for most, feel free to review to be sure none was missed.
- Review speaker bios: excerpts and thumbs should be in place for most. Review speaker meta in the control panel (gravatar email, etc)
- Once review is complete publish each item.
