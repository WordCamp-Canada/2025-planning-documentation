# Design

The Design Team ensures that all WCEH materials—digital and physical—are visually cohesive and aligned with the event’s branding.

## Key Responsibilities
- Designing marketing materials such as banners, social media graphics, and email templates.
- Creating on-site visuals, including signage, name badges, and slide decks.
- Ensuring that branding is consistently applied across all communication materials.
- Working with sponsors to integrate their branding in a non-intrusive way.

## Early Questions
- What are the core brand colours, fonts, and style guidelines for WCEH?
- How do we ensure accessibility in our visual materials (contrast, legibility, etc.)?
- What formats and dimensions are needed for different platforms and materials?
- How do we balance sponsor visibility with the event’s overall branding?

## Opportunities for Excellence
- Create a branded toolkit for speakers and sponsors to promote their involvement.
- Develop a consistent, recognizable aesthetic that builds WCEH’s identity year-over-year.
- Implement interactive and dynamic visuals for social media engagement.
