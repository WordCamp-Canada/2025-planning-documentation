# Sponsor Engagement

A successful sponsorship is about more than just visibility—it’s about creating meaningful engagement between sponsors and attendees.

## Key Responsibilities
- Designing networking and engagement opportunities tailored to sponsor objectives.
- Facilitating sponsor-led activities such as Circles (networking events) and sponsored dinners.
- Encouraging sponsors to participate in thought leadership opportunities (panels, roundtables, etc.).
- Gathering feedback from sponsors to improve future engagement strategies.

## Early Questions
- How do we ensure sponsor engagement feels natural rather than overly promotional?
- What attendee-sponsor matchmaking strategies can we implement?
- What post-event follow-ups can we provide to reinforce sponsor relationships?

## Opportunities for Excellence
- Offer structured networking sessions that connect sponsors with relevant attendees.
- Provide sponsors with data-driven insights on their engagement performance.
- Develop creative sponsor activations that enhance rather than interrupt the attendee experience.
