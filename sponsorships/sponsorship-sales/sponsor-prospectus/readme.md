# **WCEH 2025 Sponsorship Prospectus**

## **Why Sponsor WCEH?**
WCEH is Canada’s premier national WordCamp event, one of only two national WordCamps worldwide. As we enter our second year, we’re building on the momentum of last year’s sold-out event, which hosted over 250 attendees from across the WordPress ecosystem. Our focus is on creating **engaging, high-value sponsorship experiences** that go beyond just brand placement—our sponsors become an integral part of the attendee experience, forging meaningful connections with their target audiences.

Sponsoring WCEH is an opportunity to engage deeply with the WordPress community, showcase your brand in front of decision-makers, and create lasting relationships with developers, agency leaders, and business owners who rely on WordPress.

## **WordCamps: A Brief History & Why They Matter**
WordCamps have been a cornerstone of the WordPress community for nearly two decades. These events, held in cities across the globe, provide a collaborative space where developers, designers, marketers, and business owners come together to learn, share insights, and build connections. Unlike traditional tech conferences, WordCamps emphasize open-source values, accessibility, and grassroots community-building.

What sets WCEH apart is its **national scale**—a rarity in the WordCamp ecosystem. Most WordCamps are regional or city-based, making WCEH one of very few national WordCamps in the world. This distinction positions WCEH as a high-profile event, drawing attendees from across the country and beyond.

## **Why Non-WordPress Companies Should Get Involved**
While WCEH is deeply rooted in the WordPress ecosystem, its audience extends beyond developers and website builders. **Marketers, content strategists, educators, and entrepreneurs** also attend, looking for new tools, services, and technologies to support their businesses. This opens the door for companies outside the WordPress space to engage with a tech-savvy, business-oriented audience.

## **The WCEH Difference**
Unlike regional WordCamps, our national scope attracts a broad audience of professionals, making this an unparalleled opportunity for sponsors seeking to reach WordPress users at scale. We offer:
- **Curated Networking Experiences** – Thoughtfully designed sponsorship activations that foster real engagement.
- **Highly Engaged Attendees** – Developers, agency owners, and business leaders who actively seek new solutions and partnerships.
- **Strong ROI for Sponsors** – Targeted branding, lead generation, and face-to-face interactions that create tangible business outcomes.
