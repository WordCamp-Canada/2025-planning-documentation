## **Sponsorship Benefits and Engagement Opportunities**

### **Circles (Networking Events)**
At scheduled times throughout the event, we will facilitate sponsor-led networking circles where attendees can engage in targeted discussions. These circles allow sponsors to connect directly with their ideal customer segments. This opportunity is exclusive to **Confederation** and **Northern Lights** sponsors, with a total of six slots available over two days.

### **Activity Sponsorship - Evening Dinners**
To foster high-value networking opportunities, we are coordinating intimate dinners at restaurants across the city. These dinners are capped at 30 people and operate on a first-come, first-served basis. As organizers, we handle the logistics, while sponsors cover the cost of drinks (with the option to cover more). This exclusive opportunity is available to **Global, Confederation, and Northern Lights** sponsors.

### **Content Marketing Opportunities**
Sponsors receive brand exposure through **blog posts** and **social media** mentions. Higher-tier sponsors receive **individual recognition**, while lower-tier sponsors are grouped together in promotional materials. This ensures fair visibility for all sponsors while giving premium sponsors a higher level of exposure.

### **Booth and Exhibit Space**
For companies wanting a physical presence at the event, we offer dedicated and shared booth spaces:
- **Exclusive Booth/Table**: Confederation and Northern Lights sponsors receive a dedicated 6’ table in the sponsor area. Confederation sponsors also receive an end-cap placement, providing additional space.
- **Shared/Scheduled Booth/Table**: Great Lakes and Maple Leaf sponsors can choose between sharing a booth with another sponsor or having a scheduled time slot at a designated table.

### **On-Site Branding & Visibility**
All sponsors receive brand exposure through **slide decks** displayed between sessions, **swag bag inserts**, and **on-stage acknowledgments**. Sponsors at the **Laurentian tier ($1,000 CAD)** can also claim exclusive branding opportunities such as **coffee carts, meal sponsorships, snack stations, and after-party branding**. These branded opportunities are assigned on a first-come, first-served basis.

## **Sponsorship Outreach Strategy**
Securing sponsors requires a strategic approach. Here’s how our team should approach outreach:

1. **Identify Potential Sponsors**
   - Focus on companies that benefit from exposure to the WordPress ecosystem.
   - Prioritize existing partners and those with a history of supporting WordCamps.

2. **Customize the Pitch**

   - Emphasize high-impact opportunities such as networking circles and activity sponsorships.

3. **Create Urgency**

   - Encourage early sign-ups to maximize exposure leading up to the event.

4. **Streamline the Process**
   - Provide sponsors with clear instructions on how to sign up and confirm their sponsorship level.
   - Offer flexible payment options and answer any logistical questions upfront.
