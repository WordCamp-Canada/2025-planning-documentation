# Circles

Circles are curated small-group discussions that allow attendees to connect based on shared interests and professional goals. The Activities Team will facilitate the logistics of these conversations, ensuring a structured yet organic experience. 

## Key Responsibilities

- Identifying popular and relevant topics for discussion.
- Recruiting and training facilitators to guide conversations effectively.
- Coordinating with sponsors who are eligible to host Circles while ensuring discussions remain valuable for attendees.
- Ensuring Circles are structured to foster deep engagement while allowing flexibility.
- Providing comfortable and accessible spaces for discussions.
- Promoting Circles so attendees know how to join and benefit from them.

## Early Questions

- What structure works best for Circles (e.g., free-flowing discussions vs. guided prompts)?
- How do we ensure that Circles remain attendee-focused rather than sponsor-driven?
- What is the best way to match attendees with relevant Circles?
- How do we measure the impact of these discussions?

## Opportunities for Excellence

- Use an event app to allow attendees to sign up for Circles and suggest topics.
- Provide facilitators with clear guidelines and conversation prompts.
- Record key takeaways from Circles and share insights with attendees post-event.
- Ensure inclusivity by offering a mix of technical, business, and casual discussions.
