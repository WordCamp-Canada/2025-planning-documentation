# After-Party

The after-party is a signature social event that brings attendees together in a relaxed setting to unwind, network, and celebrate a successful conference. At this stage, the after-party is optional until we've secured enough sponsorships to support it.

## Key Responsibilities

- Selecting and securing a venue that aligns with the conference's atmosphere.
- Organizing entertainment, music, and interactive experiences.
- Managing food and beverage options to cater to diverse dietary needs.
- Coordinating transportation options to and from the venue.
- Ensuring the after-party is inclusive, welcoming, and safe.

## Early Questions

- Should the after-party be ticketed or open to all attendees?
- How do we balance fun with inclusivity and accessibility?
- How do we handle noise levels and ensure a mix of quiet and lively spaces?
- What sponsorship opportunities exist within the after-party setting?

## Opportunities for Excellence

- Incorporate regional entertainment (e.g., local bands, cultural performances).
- Introduce thematic elements that align with WordPress or Canada.
- Create unique networking opportunities, such as conversation starters or icebreakers.
- Offer alternative spaces for quieter socializing.
