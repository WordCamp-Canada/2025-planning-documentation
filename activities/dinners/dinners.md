# Dinners

Dinners at WCEH provide structured networking and relationship-building opportunities in an intimate setting. The Activities Team will coordinate logistics for sponsor-hosted dinners to ensure smooth execution.

## Key Responsibilities

- Organizing official WCEH dinners and coordinating logistics such as reservations and attendee sign-ups.
- Facilitating dinners by liaising with sponsors, restaurants, and attendees.
- Managing dietary preferences and accessibility considerations.

## Early Questions

- How do we encourage organic networking while keeping dinners structured?
- Should dinners have predefined topics or be open-ended?
- What role should volunteers play in ensuring smooth execution of dinners?
- How do we ensure a balance of sponsor visibility without overshadowing attendee experience?

## Opportunities for Excellence

- Offer themed dinners to cater to different attendee interests (e.g., women in WordPress, plugin developers, accessibility advocates).
- Develop an easy-to-use RSVP and matchmaking system to help attendees find relevant groups.
- Partner with local restaurants to offer curated dining experiences that reflect Canadian cuisine.
- Incorporate elements like ‘mystery guests’ (industry leaders) to make dinners more engaging.
